counting channel general commands:
`-leaderboard` shows the top 10 people who have counted the most
`-myscore` shows the number of times you have counted

pets-and-animals channel features: type a turtle emoji or any message with the word `turtle` in it to get a random(ish) response

school channel feature: you can enter the courses that you are taking (or plan on taking) for the following term and from this database of courses that people have indicated they are taking you can search for who is taking what courses. The following commands are available for this feature:
`-addcourse COURSENAME` allows you to add a course to the list of courses that you are taking in the following term. There should be **no spaces** in the course name, for example ECON 101 should be instead written as ECON101. There is also a hard cap of 10 courses that each person can indicate that they are taking in a term. If you plan on taking more than 10, first of all, good luck, and also if you would like I can increase the cap
`-delcourse COURSENAME` allows you to delete a course from your list of courses. Again, there should be **no spaces** in the course name
`-whoistaking COURSENAME` allows you to search for who is taking a particular course. Again, there should be **no spaces** in the course name
`-mycourses` allows you to see what courses you have indicated that you are currently taking
`-allcourses` will show the list of all courses that everyone is taking (that has added courses to this feature). Since this particular command can get very expensive to run, for now it is only able to be run by `WenWen (isaac, 2B CS)`. If you would like to see the results of this command, message or @ `WenWen (isaac, 2B CS)`

If you find a bug or have a feature idea, message `WenWen (isaac, 2B CS)`. Note that this bot will not be online 24/7, it has to be manually enabled. If the bot is not online, none of the features will work - this is not a bug.
