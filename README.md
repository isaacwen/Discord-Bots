# Discord-Bots
I created several custom Discord bots using Python. The features supported by my Discord bots range from channel statistics and animated emotes to popular board games Uno and Coup with multiplayer support.

To see the full list of features provided by each bot, as well as steps as to how to configure each bot for your own server (excluding Bestie-Bot), see the designated directories.
